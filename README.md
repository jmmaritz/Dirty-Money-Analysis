Microbes on circulating currency

## DESCRIPTION

This fileset contains the commands used to carry out the analysis in the manuscript:

Maritz, *et al*. (2017) [Filthy lucre: A metagenomic pilot study of microbes found on circulating currency in New York City][Paper] *PLOS ONE*, 12: 4. 


Swabs of circulating $1 bills in New York City were subjected to shotgun metagenomic sequencing and basic culturing. Additionally we compared bioinformatic workflows (assembly vs read-based).
